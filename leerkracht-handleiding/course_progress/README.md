# Cursusvoortgang

The _Course progress_ tool ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics251%20%283%29.png) \(or perhaps _Course diary_ - the name of this tool is still under consideration\) allows the teacher to build a course program to be shown \(optionally\) on the course homepage to include a progress status relative to the current teachers and learners' progress in the scheduled topic preparation.

This tool is only useful in the case of “synchronous” courses, in which the teacher and the learners progress through the course concurrently. Configuring _Course progress_ is quite easy, although quite a lengthy process.
