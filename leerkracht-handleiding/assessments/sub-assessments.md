# Subbeoordelingen

The assessments tool allows you to define several “sub-assessments” inside the assessments tool, or to just use the upper-level assessments tool to distribute your activities. We believe using sub-assessments is a bit more complex and we should avoid generating more confusion at this point, so let’s just keep it at that: if necessary, you can create a lower level of assessments inside the assessments tool, using the yellow folder creation icon \(![](../../.gitbook/assets/image5%20%286%29.svg)![](../../.gitbook/assets/image5%20%2810%29.png)\).
