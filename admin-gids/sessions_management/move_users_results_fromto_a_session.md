# Verplaats gebruikersresultaten van / naar een sessie

In the case you would want to move from a session-less mode to a session-full mode, you might \(in exceptional cases\) want to move a specific students' tracking data from a course-context to a session-context. This \(still unstable\) tool has been written exactly for that.

Its interface is complex but relatively self-explaining. If you have doubts, we recommend you take backups, act cautiously and maybe contact an official Chamilo provider to take care of it...
