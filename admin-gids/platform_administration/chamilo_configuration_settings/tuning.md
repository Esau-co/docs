# Afstemmen

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/graficos13%20%281%29.png)This category allows you to configure only one setting so far to improve efficiency a little.

**Split users' upload directory** allow you to improve speed a little bit for very high load platforms by splitting the users directories \(but this requires a manual operation on disk as well\).

Since version 1.8.8.4, you can also find optimisation hints in _chamilo/documentation/optimization.html_.

**Activate the browser sniffer** will scan the users' browsers for specific features.
