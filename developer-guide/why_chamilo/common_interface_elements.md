# Common interface elements

![](../../.gitbook/assets/images24%20%285%29.png) Because we know that common conventions make things easier for everybody to remember and manipulate, we use a set of common visual symbols throughout Chamilo. These symbols might stand alone representing an action, or be coupled with another symbol representing the object of the action.

Below are listed some of the most commonly used symbols on the platform:

| Icons | Features |
