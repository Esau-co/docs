# Structure

To allow us to modify the templates, let us understand how they work.

Each template has an entry in the _system\_template_ table in the database. Let's look at one existing record:

* id: 1: an automatic ID generated by the database
* title: TemplateTitleCourseTitle: a language variable name for the title to be shown, can be found in main/lang/\[language\]/trad4all.inc.php. Can also be a plain title for single-language portals
* comment: TemplateTitleCourseTitleDescription: a language variable for the description
* image: coursetitle.gif: an image to represent the template in the left column. This image is located in app/home/default\_platform\_document/template\_thumb/
* content: ... the HTML content ... \(the template itself\)
