# SOAP, REST en XML-RPC

If you get a little into it, you'll find that we have started developing different kinds of webservices, in SOAP but also in REST and XML-RPC.

However, the most used and maintained version is probably SOAP \(for no particular reason\) and is concentrated into one single file: main/webservices/registration.soap.php
