## Courses list {#courses-list}

This tool allows you to visualise all the courses contained on the platform.

This list gives us a great deal of information about the courses. Note the colours of the dots prefixing the courses titles: they represent the visibility of the courses:

*   blue : public

*   green : opened to platform users

*   orange : private, users are subscribed by teachers or admins

*   red : closed (for maintenance or expiration, generally), the course is not available except for course teachers and administrators

It also allows us to modify information in one click on an action icon on the right side.

From version 1.9.8 up, a new visibility: hidden (grey icon) allows courses to be hidden to everybody **but** administrators.
