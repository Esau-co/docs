### Update course details {#update-course-details}

To update the details of a course, click on the pencil icon on the right. As an admin, it is possible to change as many information as the teacher/creator of the course in the course settings.

However, the admin can also update the allowed disk space for the course and mark it as a _Special course_, which makes it visible on top of the list of courses for all users of the platform.
