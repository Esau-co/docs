# Courses management {#courses-management}

**Courses are spaces** within which teachers generate content using the 20-or so tools available to teach this content (and much more) to their student in a memorable, dynamical, multimedia and if possible entertaining way.

Courses can be used as timeless resources (and they are, most of the time), but they can also be inserted into a time-based context through the use of **sessions******(see Chapter 7\. Sessions management on page 64).

Courses management can be done with icons you should already be familiar with at this time :
