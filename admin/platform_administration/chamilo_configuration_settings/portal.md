### Portal {#portal}

![](../../assets/graficos5.png)This category allows you to configure globally-visible information, users registration, or other options that do not fit in any other category. Some of this information can be left empty. In this case, it will not be shown.

**Registration** allows you to authorize the creation of accounts by external users, to only allow the admin to create them, or to require the admin&#039;s approval for the creation of the user account.

**Registration as t****eache****r** allows you to let any new user choose to be a teacher (and as such to create new courses). You generally _don&#039;t_ want this option to be enabled.

**Enable learner view** allows you to let teachers have a preview of what their course would look like seen as a student. It is a highly useful tool and we don&#039;t recommend you remove this feature.

**Page after login** allows you to select whether you want the user to get back to your platform welcome page (Homepage), to go directly to their courses list (My courses_)_ or to go to the courses catalogue.

Tabs in header allows you to select which tabs you want to show in the tabs bar. Any tab unselected from this list will cease to appear in the tabs bar, but it will still be accessible through the user vertical menu on the _My courses_ page. Make sure you don&#039;t remove them all from the header at the same time.

**Allow non admin to create** **courses** allows teachers to create courses. It is allowed by default, but in a strongly-structured organization, you&#039;ll want the admin to setup the courses and their teachers, so this option might be better turned off.

Learners access to courses catalogue lets you decide whether the students can see the courses catalogue (available as a link on their courses list page) or not. The course catalogue gives links to course subscription, so removing the access will also prevent them from registering by themselves.

**Enable terms and conditions** enables the special _terms and conditions_ feature (that you will then have to configure from the administration page). Terms and conditions deal with languages and versions, and ensure your students have access to your portal only if they agree with the latest version.

Show link to report bug allows you to remove the little ladybug in a green floating tab on the right of the screen. It is recommended to disable this option on any production portal.

Courses validation allows you to enable a feature by which “requests” for courses can be done by teachers. The admin will have an additional interface through which he&#039;ll authorize the creation of new courses.

Enable watermark in PDF export allows you to upload an image or text to be added to all PDF exports on the system.

Font resize accessibility feature allows you to show a small set of letters on the top-right side of your portal to let users make fonts larger (for better reading) without affecting the platform.

Show admin toolbar allows you to control the top-page floating admin bar that has appeared by default in Chamilo versions after 1.9\. If you don&#039;t like it, just disable it.

Allow global chat allows you to disable the new FB-like chat feature at the bottom-right of your browser. This feature only works with Chamilo&#039;s-social-network-friends, and it is automatically disabled when entering an exercise. However, we haven&#039;t tried it under high load conditions, and you might want to make sure it will not slow down your server before you let this feature enabled.

Use the email as username this very recent feature allows you to let users identify themselves using their e-mails as a username, rather than their maybe-difficult-to-remember alias on this portal.

Allow unsubscription from platform is a feature that comes as a response to administrators&#039; requests to let users unsubscribe from a Chamilo portal if they do not want their data to be kept. When unsubscribing, all user information will be definitively removed from the portal, so you might want to think about enabling it. When enabled, an additional menu entry will appear in the user&#039;s social network page.

Enable e-mail alerts templates, although still incomplete at this time, allows you to configure templates for e-mails to be sent upon specific events detected in Chamilo.

Show hot courses will allow you to disable the default option of showing the most popular courses on the homepage.
