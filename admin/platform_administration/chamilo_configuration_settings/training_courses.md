### Training (courses) {#training-courses}

![](../../assets/graficos6.png)This tab allows you to configure the options related to the courses, be them in relation to the course user, its creator or even the purely technical side. Check each option carefully to match your needs.

Some choices are available that influence the usability of the platform, as the way you show the homepage or the tools shortcuts bar.

Training homepage design allows you to switch the appearance of your course homepage (where all tools icons reside). Previously, the design of the course homepage was “Activity view”, but it has now been replaced by the more mobile-friendly “Big activity view”, which gives larger and more inviting icons.

Tools shortcuts makes a toolbar appear inside the course, allowing you to quickly jump from one tool to another. It is a popular feature amongst many Chamilo users, but it can only be enabled/disabled at the platform level. It appears horizontally, just below the page&#039;s breadcrumb.

**Default hard disk space** is the space allowed for documents in a specific course&#039;s document tool. It is set to 95.4MB by default, which is for historical reasons (it&#039;s the equivalent of 100,000,000 bytes, in 1024 base). You can change this option on a course basis through the courses list in the administration page. Only an admin can do that, though. Changing the option here will only affect future courses.

Display training navigation menu is another type of toolbar, appearing on the right hand side of the courses pages.

Show glossary terms in documents allows you to enable the auto-parsing of glossary terms in documents of the same course.

Go directly to the course after login makes the user go directly to the course homepage in case he&#039;s only registered in one course. This makes for a much better user experience for users who only ever come to quickly get studying on their single active course.

Enable quiz scenario allows you to enable the adaptative exercises. These exercises can drive a student dynamically through a moving path of questions, depending on his answers to previous questions.

Default course visibility indicates which visibility new courses will have by default. It is recommended (for private portals) to set this option to “Private” so students cannot subscribe on their own. The default is “Open” and will allow students to subscribe.

Allow public certificates allows you to define whether students&#039; certificates will be visible to the public or not. Certificates are generated from inside the _Assessments_ tool in a course.
