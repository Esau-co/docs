### Tuning {#tuning}

![](../../assets/graficos13.png)This category allows you to configure only one setting so far to improve efficiency a little.

**Split users&#039; upload directory** allow you to improve speed a little bit for very high load platforms by splitting the users directories (but this requires a manual operation on disk as well).

Since version 1.8.8.4, you can also find optimisation hints in _chamilo/documentation/optimization.html_.

**Activate the browser sniffer** will scan the users&#039; browsers for specific features.
