### Sessions {#sessions}

![](../../assets/images18.png)In this category, you will find all sessions-related options. In the past, these options were spread across other sections, but the growth of the sessions-related features have made this section necessary. Sessions control groups of courses which are taught to common groups (classes) of students. By using sessions, you benefit from a series of advantages in terms or re-use of content and splitting of students tracking between two separate spaces. To learn more about sessions, check chapter 7Sessions management.

Register users by coach, although its name is a bit unclear, lets you decide whether session coaches can subscribe new students to the platform.

Allow coaches to edit inside course sessions allows you to define whether session coaches can edit content into their session or not.

Hide courses list in sessions allows you to change the way the _My courses_ page looks like, by putting the focus on the session rather than the course.

Allow session administrators to see all sessions allows you to define whether users who have the _Session administrator_ role can see only the sessions they have created or also the ones other session administrators have created. This is kind of a privilege isolation feature.
