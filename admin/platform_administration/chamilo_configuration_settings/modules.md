### Modules {#modules}

![](../../assets/graficos9.png)This category defines the properties of the course tools and global tools, globally (influences all courses).

**Modules active upon** **course** **creation** are the tools which will be visible by default in a newly created course. Teachers can then update these settings to fit their needs.

Deleted files cannot be restored if a file is deleted, you have a choice whether you want the system to delete it completely or to keep a secret backup file with a __DELETED_ suffix. Delete files will not be visible through the system any more, but you&#039;ll be able to find them on disk.

**Online e-mail editor** enabled lets you decide whether you want to give your users a way to send e-mails to other users of the platform (by e-mail) without requiring an external e-mail client. Try it by enabling the feature then clicking on the admin contact link in the portal footer.

**Booking** is a tool that lacks a lot of love (translate: has a very bad interface) but has potential: once well configured, you can set resources up inside your platform to book them and show their availability.

Internal messaging tool allows you to disable the messages box in the social network.

Social network tool (Facebook-like) allows you to disable the social network feature. If disabled, the _Social network_ tab will say _Profile_ and users won&#039;t be able to invite and communicate with friends through the portal.

Allow learners to create groups in social network allows normal students to create their own groups.

Allow sending messages to any platform user is a privacy feature to avoid spamming. On a large portal, users should probably be required to be “approved friends” before they can send messages to one another. The default is to allow anyone to message anyone else.

Create and edit SVG files enables the SVGEdit software inside the documents tool. We recommend to let this setting enabled as the tool is great and adds a lot of flexibility to the document building.

Enable online services for text to speech conversion lets you enable the text-to-speech feature in the documents tool. We recommend you enable it. It is not enabled by default to avoid users frustration in case the server does not have an internet connection (which is required for the feature to work).

Hide tools from teachers allows you to select tools that you want to hide on the whole platform. Not even the course teachers will be able to see them.

Enable external Pixlr services allows you to enable the photo edition tool in the documents tool. This requires the end user to have an internet connection (just connecting to the Chamilo server doesn&#039;t guarantee it will work).

Activate recorder - voice player Nanogongallows you to enable a voice recorder (Java Applet) in the documents tool.

Activate Wami-recorder enables another voice recorder, this one in Flash, in the documents tool. Enabling Wami or Nanogong really depends on what software is most available on your users&#039; computers.

Enable Webcam Clip enables a feature taking pictures from your webcam in the documents tool. This allows for faster illustration of courses by the teachers (no need for digital camera, your webcam does the trick).
