## Chamilo configuration settings {#chamilo-configuration-settings}

These settings join several categories, shown in the following illustration.

Chamilo offers a default configuration, which is not necessarily the one you would prefer. Even if all options are worth being explained, as an admin should know his environment perfectly, we&#039;re only going to see here the ones we consider the most important or more likely to be changed in comparison with the default settings. You can always find a complete list of settings in the Appendix on page 91.

Due to the number of settings now available to reconfigure your Chamilo portal, the Chamilo team built a nice and easy search feature. If you don&#039;t know where the option is, just search one related word and Chamilo will filter all the corresponding options for you!

The three links: _Configuration settings, Plugins_ and _Regions_ are actually direct links to different sections of the configuration settings, so they won&#039;t be explained separately.
