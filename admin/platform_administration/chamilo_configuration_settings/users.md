### Users {#users}

This category presents the options relative to users properties and permissions.

**Profile** defines which fields of the profile will be modifiable by the user. By default, the e-mail cannot be modified by the user himself.

**Personal agenda** lets you decide whether a user can register personal events in his calendar.

Allow users to change e-mail without password allows users to change their e-mails without having to provide their password. This is particularly dangerous as the e-mail address is where the password reminder is sent, so if someone steals another user&#039;s connection, he can change the password and prevent access by the legitimate user. The default option is to not allow it without having to give one&#039;s password, which is more secure but a little more complicated.
