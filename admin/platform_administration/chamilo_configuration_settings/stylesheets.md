Since version 1.8.7, it is possible for you to create your own stylesheets and send them to the server. In order to do this, download a copy of one of the existing styles in _chamilo/main/css/_ and change the name of the recovered directory (on your computer, not on the server). Modify the style to your taste. Once you&#039;re happy with the changes, send the directory to the server as a .zip file and give it a name that corresponds to your portal.

Then, select the style in the drop-down list. If you&#039;re happy with it, click the _Save settings_ button to apply it as a default style for your portal.
