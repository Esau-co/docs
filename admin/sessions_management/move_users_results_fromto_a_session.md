## Move users results from/to a session {#move-users-results-from-to-a-session}

In the case you would want to move from a session-less mode to a session-full mode, you might (in exceptional cases) want to move a specific students&#039; tracking data from a course-context to a session-context. This (still unstable) tool has been written exactly for that.

Its interface is complex but relatively self-explaining. If you have doubts, we recommend you take backups, act cautiously and maybe contact an official Chamilo provider to take care of it...
