## Copy from course in session to another session {#copy-from-course-in-session-to-another-session}

Given the possibility to define content in a course through a session and given the fact that this content will only be visible within this session, you will sometimes need to copy that session-specific content to another session containing the same course... and this is exactly what this tool does.

To use it, you must have an origin and a destination session, in which you can find the same course, from and to which you wish to copy the content of the session.

Once these conditions are met, you&#039;ll just have to select the session of origin, the course of origin, the session of destination and the course of destination, then decide whether you want all session-specific contents to be copied or only some of them.

**Note** : this tool is still in beta version. We recommend you use it with caution and you counter-check it does what you expected.
