## Sessions categories (or periods) {#sessions-categories-or-periods}

Session categories are to be considered as any possible type of sessions categorisation. In our experience, however, they are mostly fit to group sessions together by periods of time (for example, _the first semester of 201__4_). Of course, the type of time periods depends on the organisation using Chamilo. Sometimes quarter, sometimes semester, sometimes month or year.

The management of sessions categories is very similar to the management of courses categories, so we won&#039;t get into the details here. The only thing to know is that date of sessions categories are purely informational and do not bear any significance in terms of behaviour of the platform.
