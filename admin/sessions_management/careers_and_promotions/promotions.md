### Promotions {#promotions}

The only two differences between careers and promotions is that a promotion can be included to a career, while a career cannot include sessions directly. Creating a promotion once you have created a career is then very easy.

The creation of promotions is followed by the registration of sessions within these promotions, using the sessions icon for each promotion in the list of promotions.

One then obtains a list similar to the following (already show before).
