# Sessions management {#sessions-management}

A session is a mechanism which hover “above” one or several courses and allows groups of students to follow the same group of courses during the same period, in separate virtual spaces.

Sessions can group several courses of different categories.

The following schema has already been used in the _users_ chapter to explain roles, but we will now use it in the context of _Sessions._

As you can see, the session is defined by a sessions administrator and has a general coach (also called the session coordinator, or _session tutor_ in the schema) who watches over the session and assists teachers and students in need.

Several courses are registered to the session, each of them being taught by one or more course coaches (_session-course tutor_ on the schema).

Although not clearly represented on this schema, a session allows you (optionally) to establish time limits for the coaches and learners of this session.
