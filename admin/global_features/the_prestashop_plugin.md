## The Prestashop plugin {#the-prestashop-plugin}

If you want to turn your Chamilo portal into an online shop for courses... you can&#039;t. Well, you can&#039;t do that directly, but there is an easy way to avoid that problem: using a real online shop system and connecting it to Chamilo.

Prestashop[^20] is a very popular, free software, online shop system that will allow you to setup your own online shop in a few hours.

Once you&#039;ve got your shop installed and configure, go download the Chamilo plugin for Prestashop[^21]. On the plugin&#039;s wiki, you&#039;ll find a very extensive and simple installation guide to help you through the configuration. Once it&#039;s all configured, you&#039;ll be able to charge students to access your courses.

At this time, the plugin doesn&#039;t work with sessions, so you will sell an unlimited access to your courses, but we hope to have this plugin extended in this direction in the future.
