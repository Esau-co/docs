## Style sheets {#style-sheets}

As mentioned in section 4.1.14 Stylesheets on page 36, the Chamilo styles can be updated through a simple copy of any of the existing styles located in _chamilo/main/css/_. You&#039;ll find a series of styles directories in this directory, e.g. _chamilo_green_, which can be copied, renamed and modified at wish. To test them, just go to the _Stylesheets_ section of your portal configuration page, upload your style as a .zip file and select the style uploaded, then save.
