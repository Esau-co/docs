### The solution {#the-solution}

We call this solution _multi-URL_. By enabling multi-URL, you enable the following mechanism:

*   you use the same source code (so less maintenance)

*   you use the same database (so less duplication of data)

*   one “master” portal (which is not used directly by your customers) allows you to define “slave” portals

*   each course is created inside a “slave” portal, and is only visible inside this slave portal

*   each user is created inside a “slave” portal, is only visible inside this portal and has only access to this portal

*   each slave portal uses a different domain name (or a different sub-domain)

*   each portal can use its own graphic style

*   one (or more) administrator can be assigned to each slave portal. This administrator doesn&#039;t have access to global settings, neither to the users and courses of other portals

*   one session can use a global course, but each session only exists in one and only one portal

Using the same database, you benefit from these “extra features”:

*   one course can be made “global” and be used through sessions on all slave portals

*   one user (learner, teacher or administrator) can be given access to other portals by the global administrator
