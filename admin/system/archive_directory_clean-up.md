## Archive directory clean-up {#archive-directory-clean-up}

The archives/ directory is used to store temporary data. XLS exports, courses backups, etc. As such, and unless you have a cron job running regularly to clean it up, you should clean it manually once in a while. This link allows you to do just that, without requiring direct access to the files directory.
