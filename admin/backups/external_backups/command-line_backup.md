### Command-line backup {#command-line-backup}

If you are more of a Linux sysadmin, you can take a backup with a command of this type, where the final part is the file where you want to save it (and &#039;olimahc&#039; is the password):

mysqldump -u chamilo -polimahc chamilo19x &gt; chamilo-backup-file.sql
