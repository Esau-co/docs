### The human resources manager (or supervisor) {#the-human-resources-manager-or-supervisor}

It is an exclusive role (it cannot be combined with another role). The aim of this role is to follow users, courses or sessions in particular, as a human resources manager would do with an employee he&#039;s been assigned to. It is an observation role. As such, he cannot modify anything. |
