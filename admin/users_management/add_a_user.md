## Add a user {#add-a-user}

The administrator can add users by creating them out of an empty form. He will only need to give:

*   « firstname »

*   « lastname »

*   « e-mail »

*   « login »

There are, however, advanced options to which one should pay attention.

The user account can have an expiration date. In this case, one has to choose the end of the subscription period.

Finally, the user account can be created active or inactive, waiting for example for the start of a new sessions.

Three new fields have been added to Chamilo 1.8.8\. These fields allow you to configure the frequency to which personal messages sent from the Chamilo social network to your account are sent to you by e-mail.
