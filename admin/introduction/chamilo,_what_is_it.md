## Chamilo, what is it ? {#chamilo-what-is-it}

Chamilo LMS is an e-learning system (that is it manages learning) developed in a collaborative way by several companies, associations and people, through an open model called « free software » (as in _freedom_).

You can download and use Chamilo freely, given you accept its license (GNU/GPLv3) which gives you, in short, four essential freedoms, given your compromise to maintain those freedoms : the freedom to use, study, modify and distribute the software.

Chamilo is not only developed collaboratively by dozens of people in the world at large ; it is also supported by a non-profit association with the objective of promoting the platform and ensure its continuity. In this sense, Chamilo LMS is the only free software e-learning platform that generates so many guarantees of open access.

You can contribute to Chamilo too, promoting its use, reporting errors, suggesting improvements, translating it (or its manuals) to your native language, or even developing extensions or fixes by yourself.
