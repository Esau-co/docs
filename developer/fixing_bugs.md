# Fixing bugs

Your contribution fixing bugs is much appreciated.

To enable the right level of tracking of any bug, we first ask you to report it in 
the [Github issues page](https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/issues) and follow the
contributions guide to report it.

If you can fix it, that is even more appreciated. To do that, the requested procedure is to:
 - clone the repository (in your Github account)
 - create a new branch in your repository (preferably with a name that matches the issue ID number)
 - develop your patch and write a few comments helping us understand it
 - send it to your branch
 - in your branch, submit the whole branch as a Pull Request with additional explanations (ideally, add a screenshot of the issue and its resolution to your Pull Request)
 
If you have followed these steps carefully, there's a big chance we will attend your Pull Request very
quickly, and your name will remain as a contributor of Chamilo for the years to come! (through Github's history)
