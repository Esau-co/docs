Chamilo is an e-learning and collaboration platform which comes bundled as open-source software (or as purists will rightfully correct, _Free Software_) which can be adapted to educational or professional projects. It is distributed under the [GNU/GPLv3+](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_publique_générale_GNU) license, which you are bound to accept when using it.

Chamilo (as a software) has two key aims:

1.  to support the teacher in better responding to the needs of their students and

2.  to make it so easy to build and edit high-quality digital learning materials that the teacher can not only create but be inspired to develop and continuously improve their courses&#039; content.

The goal of the Chamilo Association, through the publishing of Chamilo, is to "Increase the availability of quality education worldwide".

A teacher using Chamilo can access a series of useful tools allowing them to easily and efficiently create an effective learning environment. On creating/editing a course he (or she) can:
*   import or create **documents** (audio, video, images) and publish them,
*   build **tests** and **exams** with **automated scores and feedback** as required,
*   build or import ([SCORM](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharable_Content_Object_Reference_Model) and [AICC](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_Industry_CBT_Committee)) compliant courses,
*   set and receive **virtual assignments**,
*   describe the components of the course through **description** sections,
*   communicate through **forums** or **chat**,
*   publish **announcements**,
*   add **links**,
*   create **work groups** or laboratory groups,

The Chamilo platform is extremely **flexible**. All its tools can be customized according to the needs of each course. It provides a **friendly** and **intuitive** user interface which requires no special prior technical knowledge or skills.
