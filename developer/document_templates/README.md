## Document templates {#document_templates}

When creating new documents in courses (in the Documents tool), 
you will see a left column showing a series of document templates.

Those templates can be extended inside the course itself. In this
case, they remain specific to the course.

But an administrator can also create (or update) global templates.
Go to Administration -> Platform settings -> Templates for that.

However, this feature is relatively limited in Chamilo 1.9-1.11. Even
if you can place new templates there, they cannot easily, for example,
include new media (there is no way to upload the corresponding files)
and you will need to use specific variables to avoid Chamilo to transform
erroneously the links to the CSS and JS files you might want to include.

So there is an alternative way, but it takes a bit of effort. That is what
we explain in the following section.
