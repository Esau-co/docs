## Structure of the document templates

To allow us to modify the templates, let us understand how they work.

Each template has an entry in the *system_template* table in the database. Let's look at one existing record:

* id: 1: an automatic ID generated by the database
* title: TemplateTitleCourseTitle: a language variable name for the title to be shown, can be found in main/lang/[language]/trad4all.inc.php. Can also be a plain title for single-language portals
* comment: TemplateTitleCourseTitleDescription: a language variable for the description
* image: coursetitle.gif: an image to represent the template in the left column. This image is located in app/home/default_platform_document/template_thumb/
* content: ... the HTML content ... (the template itself)
