## About this guide {#about-this-guide}

This guide has been written by members of the core team of developers behind the Chamilo LMS development. If you think you found a typing mistake or a missing feature, you can contribute to the writing and improvement of this guide too. All you need to do is drop us an e-mail at info@chamilo.org with your suggestions for improvements â€“ you could attach you own modified version of paragraphs, chapters, screen-shots or even the whole manual! It&#039;s that easy!

You can also fork the documentation project on Github, at [https://github.com/chamilo/docs](https://github.com/chamilo/docs) and send us detailed pull requests using the [MarkDown markup language][1], if this is your preferred way to work (we certainly prefer it to other methods). Note that, if you fork this repository, the Github online editor actually supports MarkDown so you could see a preview of your changes directly in your browser before you send them.

At the time of writing, the development of the 1.11 version of Chamilo LMS is still under way, but is literally slowing down, as we are now working on Chamilo LMS 2.0, which will bring vast improvements in terms of flexibility and structure.

However, it is likely that new installations of Chamilo LMS 1.11 will still be made until late 2018 and maintained until at least the end of 2019, so this manual will remain relevant until then.
