This detailed view presents a graphical visualization of the scores repartition. Each bar represents a rank of results (0-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80%, 81-100%). The global chart represents the repartition of all students&#039; results for this exercise. The orange bar is the bar in which the current user&#039;s results are located. You can click the chart to get an exploded view.
