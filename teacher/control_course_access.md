# Control course access {#control-course-access}

During the creation of the course, it is recommended you don&#039;t allow learners access before it is ready so they don&#039;t see an incomplete course.

In order to do this, access has to be restricted by going to the course **_Settings_** tool:

A series of choices are available to the teacher.

*   **Public** : means it is accessible to any user, registered on this portal or not

*   **Open** : means all users _registered on the portal_ can access the course as long as they have previously subscribed to it (they can do this through the courses catalog). This is the _default option_

*   **Private** : means the course is only available to students who have been subscribed to it by a teacher or administrator. Make sure the _Subscription_ option is set to be only available to trainers, though, as otherwise students might be able to subscribe themselves.

*   **Closed** : means the course is _only available to its teacher or the administrator._Other users cannot access it, even if they have previously been subscribed to it. This last option is recommended _during the building or_ _maintenance_ _periods of the course_.
