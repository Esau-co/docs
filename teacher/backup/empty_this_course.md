## Empty this course {#empty-this-course}

The _Empty this course_ feature ![](../assets/graphics334.gif) empties (“recycles”) either the whole course or selected elements. It deletes documents, forums, links, etc. This procedure can be executed after a course has ended and when you want to start anew in the same space. Of course, it is generally recommended that you keep a history of these courses.

Warning: Before you empty the course, make sure you take a backup copy, just in case!

To empty a course:

*   click on the _Empty this course_ link,

*   select whether you want to empty the whole course or just specific tools,

*   click the _Empty this course_ button to proceed.

### Delete the course area {#delete-the-course-area}

Click the _Delete the course area_ _![](../assets/graphics335.gif)_link to delete the course completely from the server.

Given the fact there&#039;s no way back from this, we highly recommend you consider this twice before confirming it.
