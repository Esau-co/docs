## Survey publication {#survey-publication}

If you are satisfied with the survey, you just need to publish it (make sure you don&#039;t contradict yourself with the start date, sending the invitation by e-mail for a survey which is not yet available!)

In addition/alternatively, send invitations using the same form directly by e-mail (separate email addresses using semi-colons). Invitations can be sent to people who are not registered users on the platform (e.g. you may wish to send the invitation to potential customers, or to parents of learners):

Once you have completed the fields, remember to click the _Publish survey_ button.

> **Note**: you can also invite anonymous individuals without requiring an email address (e.g. visitors to a web page) using the Generate access link icon ![](../assets/graphics294.png) in the survey listings.
