## Define the thematic plan {#define-the-thematic-plan}

Once the thematic section has been created, you can edit its entry in the _Thematic plan_ column. The _Thematic__plan_ is the definition of the objectives, methodology and other details of the newly created thematic section. Click on the _Thematic plan_ icon ![](../assets/graphics255.png) to show a form containing several fields in each of which which you can enter a title and description which will be displayed on the main C_ourse progress_ page. By default, the fields are titled: _Objectives, skills to acquire, Methodology, Infrastructure, Assessment_ and _Other,_ although these can be edited as appropriate. Fields with no description added will not be displayed.
