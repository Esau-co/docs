## Groups settings {#groups-settings}

A teacher can access settings for the group from the toolbar in the main _Groups_ page. Clicking the _Edit settings_ icon ![](../assets/graphics279.png) takes you to a page which allows you to limit the number of groups an individual user can belong to, and to make default settings for all groups including maximum group size, self registration and access privileges for all the associated tools (documents, agenda, assignments, announcements, forum, wiki and chat):
