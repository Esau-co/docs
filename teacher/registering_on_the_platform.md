# Registering on the platform {#registering-on-the-platform}

As for any web platform, users wishing to access the platform contents must register with their user name and password. This is simply done by following the _Sign up!_ link on the homepage, or by an administrator pre-registering all users. Once registered, one can simply connect using your username and password.

Once connected, the teacher has access to any courses on which (s)he is registered:

*   A list of courses to which the user is subscribed. A pencil will appear on the right of the courses boxes for which the current user is a teacher, allowing the teacher to directly go to the courses settings

*   A link to the _Social Network_ tool (which we will analyze in Social networkon p. 164)

*   A (non-admin) teacher can create a course[^4]

*   Teachers and learners can subscribe to more existing courses through a “Course catalogue”

*   Teachers and learners have access to the history of their sessions through the “Courses history”. Sessions are a vast concept detailed in the Admin Guide.

> **Note** : Although the help feature link has been replaced (since version 1.8.8) by a more dynamic, JavaScript-based box, it remains fully accessible to people with impaired vision, which might be navigating the platform through a text-based browser. Version 1.9 and upwards also offer a font resize feature for people with slightly impaired vision.
