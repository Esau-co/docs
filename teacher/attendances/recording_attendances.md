## Recording attendances {#recording-attendances}

Having set up your course sessions, you&#039;ll need to start recording your learners&#039; attendances. You do this using the _Attendances sheet,_ which you can access from the main _Attendances_ page by clicking on the relevant listing. You&#039;ll see a list of learners&#039; names in the first column, then one column for each attendance date. Generally, the default column enabled will be the first one that hasn&#039;t been modified yet.

The _Attendance sheet_ displays a table with columns listing users, their attendance and dates/times. What dates you view is controlled by the _Filter_ drop down menu in the toolbar (choose “all” and click _filter_ to see them all). To enable editing of each date column, click the “padlock” ![](../assets/graphics269.png) in the column heading.

Illustration 134: Attendances sheet

By default, the system assumes all learners are attending the course session, so **only** take note of **missing** learners, by **unchecking** the learner&#039;s box to mark his absence.

A learner missing more than 10% of the total number of sessions will be marked by an orange background. A learner missing more than 25% of the sessions will be marked by a red background. (These colourings are fixed parameters which cannot, at this point in time, be modified inside the platform.)

An attendance sheet can be included in the assessments tool as a marked resource, to count towards a students overall grades for the course.
