## Watching course quotas {#watching-course-quotas}

By default, a course quota of 100Mb is set, but it is also possible for your administrator to increase it. To check the space usage, look at the indication at the bottom of your documents list. I will indicate the percentage of your course that is being used.

If you think you might reach the course limit in a few days, contact your administrator to ask him if it is possible to increase the available space. Only the platform administrator has the power to use this feature.

If you want to get a clearer view of what is occupying space in your documents directory, click the percent icon ![](../assets/graphics125.png) . You&#039;ll see a chart like the one in Illustration 41 below.

Note : the space available in a course is only limited, in Chamilo 1.9, to the use of the documents tool. Users will be allowed to send numerous assignments without worrying about the space limit.
