## Visibility and access {#visibility-and-access}

The _Course access_ section ![](../assets/graphics323.png) allows you to define how open access to your course will be by selecting the _Course visibility_ settings (already described in Control course access on page 20). These settings (_public, open, private_ or _closed_) are fully defined on the page. On this page you can also:

*   obtain a _direct link_ to send e.g. via email or a web page to invite registration to this course

*   allow self-subscription and unsubscription

*   provide a registration password to allow access by unsubscribed users

*   establish legal terms to be displayed on entry to the course
