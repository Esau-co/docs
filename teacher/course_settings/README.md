# Course settings {#course-settings}

The _Settings_ tool ![](../assets/graphics320.png) in the _Administration_ section of the course homepage allows you to edit the overall behaviour of the course (most options will affect several tools). Although it is placed in a remote location at the bottom of the page (and at the end of this manual), it is generally a good idea to use it at the beginning of your course to manage subscription settings and course access (see later: Visibility and access Visibility and access section).

**Note**: Course tutors using the course inside the session will not have access to this tool as configuration changes might affect other sessions.
