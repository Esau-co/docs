## Marking assignments {#marking-assignments}

To mark a document uploaded by a learner, go to the main page for the relevant assignment.

If the student has not uploaded a file, but submitted their assignment using the on-line editor, the save icon will not show â€“ instead the student&#039;s assignment will be automatically shown in the editor to which the teacher can add feedback etc when scoring the work.
