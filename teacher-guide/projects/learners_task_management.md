By clicking the _Users rights management_ icon ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics317.png) in the _roles management_ page, you get a table describing users rights within the project which can be edited as appropriate. Click on the red _hasn't rights_ icons ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics319.gif) or the green _has rights_ ticks ![](../../.gitbook/assets/graphics321.gif) to toggle between them.
