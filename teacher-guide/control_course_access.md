# Control course access

During the creation of the course, it is recommended you don't allow learners access before it is ready so they don't see an incomplete course.

In order to do this, access has to be restricted by going to the course _**Settings**_ tool:

A series of choices are available to the teacher.

* **Public** : means it is accessible to any user, registered on this portal or not
* **Open** : means all users _registered on the portal_ can access the course as long as they have previously subscribed to it \(they can do this through the courses catalog\). This is the _default option_
* **Private** : means the course is only available to students who have been subscribed to it by a teacher or administrator. Make sure the _Subscription_ option is set to be only available to trainers, though, as otherwise students might be able to subscribe themselves.
* **Closed** : means the course is _only available to its teacher or the administrator.\_Other users cannot access it, even if they have previously been subscribed to it. This last option is recommended \_during the building or_ _maintenance_ _periods of the course_.
