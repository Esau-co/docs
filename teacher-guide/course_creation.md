Creating a course is quick and easy, and can be done from the _My courses_ page (top right button "+ Course").

> **Note** : on some portals, teachers might not have permissions to create new courses and are simply assigned pre-created courses by the administrator.
>
> Click on _+ Course_ button on the opposite side of the menu. Fill the mandatory “Course name” field \(see Illustration 14: Creating a course – short version\) and click the button. That's it.

The course will be visible by the course creator and \(later\) by the users
subscribed to it. By default, the person who creates the course is responsible
for this course's administration. She is generally referred to as the
**Course owner** or **Course creator**.

To create the course, you need only enter a single element, i.e. a clear and
detailed title.

Additional **options** \(entirely optional\) are available by clicking on the \_Advanced settings\_button:

* **a** **category** within the ones offered in the drop-down box \(this is optional\),
* **a** **course code** Pick a code that matches the course title associated with e.g. a numerical classification. \(n.b. Even if entered in lowercase, the course code will be automatically uppercased and symbols like _\(-,_  and spaces\_ will be removed from the code\),
* **the** **course admin** this option is automatically filled with your name and cannot be updated,
* **the** **language** used to display the course environment \(nothing stops you from using e.g. French even if the platform is installed in English\). The language choice doesn't influence the course content, only the course interface
* the course can be filled with some **demo content** to indicate to the new course administrator the sort of thing s/he can create inside the course \(typically an exercise, forums and an introduction section\). Alternatively, this can be left completely empty.
* finally, the course can be created from a template course that you have access to \(you must be a teacher in the template course to see it appear in your list\)

This empty course structure having been created, the next step is to enrich
this course through the addition of text, multimedia documents, audio files,
links etc. etc.....\)
