# Course administration

The _My courses_ tab the teacher to see a list of the courses which they can
manage. \(These display a pencil icon on the right side of the course's box,
as opposed to courses on which they are subscribed as learners\).

You just need to click on the course name to access its homepage.

The teacher can choose to hide or show distinct tools using the _eye_ icon
under each tool, so that the course doesn't intimidate the new learner with
too many options.

> **Note** : In some cases the administrator may make tools unavailable to course
teachers or enable tools which depend on specific extensions \(like the full-text
> search or the video conference\), so what you see entering the course might not
> be the same as described here.

Two special tools, _Course maintenance_ and _Course settings_ are also
available under the cog icon on the top-right side of the course screen (next
to the _Student view_ button).
