_Illustration: Course settings â€“ E-mail notifications_

In this section, you can choose to receive an e-mail notification if:

* a user subscribed to your course \(this feature has to be enabled by the platform admin\),
* a new file is submitted in the _Assignments_ or the _Dropbox_ tools,
* a test is passed by a learner.

It is also possible to set an e-mail notification to all users when a new assignment is created.
