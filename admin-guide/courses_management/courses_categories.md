# Courses categories

You can create, update or remove courses categories through common action icons. It is possible to create numerous categories and sub-categories.

It is also possible to organise these categories thanks to the arrow icons. These categories are not internationalised, so if you use a multilingual portal, make sure the name or the categorisation of your courses is easy to understand for all users.
