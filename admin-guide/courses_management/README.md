# Courses management

**Courses are spaces** within which teachers generate content using the 20-or so tools available to teach this content \(and much more\) to their student in a memorable, dynamical, multimedia and if possible entertaining way.

Courses can be used as timeless resources \(and they are, most of the time\), but they can also be inserted into a time-based context through the use of **sessions**_**\*\***_\(see Chapter 7. Sessions management on page 64\).

Courses management can be done with icons you should already be familiar with at this time :

| Icons | Features |
