# Replace the older version by the new one

There is only one recommended way to update your Chamilo version for now:

1. Don't delete the previous folder, otherwise the older configuration files will be lost.
2. Simply copy the new Chamilo directory over the old one.
   * if you use a GNU/Linux distribution, you'll have to copy the entire new directory to the old one, i.e.:

| user@server: sudo cp -r chamilo-1.11.22/\* /var/www/chamilo/ |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------|

1. Then go through the steps of the _«Last installation settings»_ documentation.
2. Login to your site and check that everything is there.
