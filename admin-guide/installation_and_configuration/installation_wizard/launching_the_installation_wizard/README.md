Once the files have beencopied to the server, point your browser at « [http://www.mydomain.com/chamilo](http://www.mydomain.com/chamilo) » or, locally, at the « [http://localhost/chamilo](http://localhost/chamilo) », depending on where exactly you put the directory.

If you were able to configure a VirtualHost in your web server's configuration, you are better off loading directly an address of this form: « [http://www.virtualhost.com/](http://www.virtualhost.com/) » without the _chamilo_ suffix\_.\_VirtualHosts are out of the scope of this guide, but you can learn about them from Apache's documentation website or Nginx's \(if you use it\).

In the following screenshots, we install Chamilo 1.9.4. The installation of all versions of 1.9.\* are almost exactly the same, so the procedure is also valid for 1.9.0, 1.9.2, 1.9.4, 1.9.6 and 1.9.8.

You must then follow a series of steps to indicate your platform parameters. These steps are almost identical for local and remote installations.
