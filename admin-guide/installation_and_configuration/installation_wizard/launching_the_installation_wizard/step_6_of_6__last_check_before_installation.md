_Illustration: Installation - Reminder_

Here, you'll be able to check all your settings a last time before launching the installation. We recommend you take a screenshot \(or print it\) and keep it in a safe place. It might be useful when reporting a bug to the Chamilo community, or in case you forgot the settings you set. If you spot a mistake in the settings, just go back and update it. Alternatively, just click on the _Install Chamilo_ button and proceed...

Once the installation is over, just go to the site by following the link given and connect with the account you just set.
