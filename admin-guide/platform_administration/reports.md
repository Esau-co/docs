# Reports

This section \(available from Chamilo LMS 1.9.4\) could be called “Executive reporting”, and gives you a special report about all users and all training hours they've been taking inside the platform. This is particularly useful for organizations providing training to other organizations' employees and having to account for that \(in man\*hours of training\).

Assuming you've only got one learning path and one “assessment” in each course, it will also give you the learning path progress, whether the student reached 100% progress, and whether he printed his certificate or not.
