# Global agenda

The global agenda allows you to add events that will be visible from the agenda of any user of the platform.

The feature is completely similar to the one you can find in the courses space, but the addition of an event there has a global reach, as all users will see it through their own calendar. Any event added this way is considered to be more important and will be shown in a different colour than other events.
